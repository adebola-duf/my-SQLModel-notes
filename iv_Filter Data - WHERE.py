        # Hero.age > 35

        # Hero.age is potentially None, and you cannot compare None with >
        # This is because as we are using pure and plain Python annotations for the fields, age is indeed annotated as Optional[int], which means int or None.
        # By using this simple and standard Python type annotations we get the benefit of the extra simplicity and the inline error checks when creating or using instances. âœ¨
        # And when we use these special class attributes in a .where(), during execution of the program, the special class attribute will know that the comparison only applies for the values that are not NULL in the database, and it will work correctly.
